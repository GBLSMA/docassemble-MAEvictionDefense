question: Getting Started
subquestion: |
  Please locate the Summons and Complaint and the Notice to Quit for your case
  before you begin. You'll be asked to look for information on both
  documents to help answer some questions. For some situations, it may help to
  refer to your lease or any written rental agreement.
  
  If you don't have either document, 
  you can still do your best to answer from your memory.

question: |
  Upcoming court dates
subquestion: |
  This interview is designed to help a tenant whose case is scheduled in court for
  the first time. It can also help you ask for permission to file late.
  What best describes ${tenant.name}'s case?
field: case.status
choices: 
  - I have a notice from my landlord but I am not scheduled for court yet.: onlyntq
  - I have a court date scheduled: summons
  - I signed an agreement in this case already. I have a new court date coming up.: afj
  - I missed my first court date.: late
default: summons
help:
  We need to know where your case is in the court process to choose the right forms.
  
  If your first court date has passed, you may be able to use a special form called a 
  "Motion to File Late Answer." This interview will help you decide.

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Both the tenant and the landlord have the right to have a jury decide the facts of their case instead of 
  a judge. This is your only chance to claim your
  right to a jury (unless you file a separate form before the answer date).
  
  #### Why claim your right to a jury trial?
  1. Members of the jury are your peers. Some may be tenants who can understand your experiences.
  1. Jury trials take time to schedule. You can use this time to try to resolve your case.
  1. You still can waive your jury trial right later. Claiming a jury trial also does not
     stop you from reaching an agreement with your landlord.
  
  There is a chance that the judge will ask you to pay rent or use and occupancy while you
  are waiting for the jury trial to be scheduled. 
  Most tenants who receive assistance in Greater Boston Legal Services clinics request a 
  jury trial.

  Method of Service
subquestion: |
  A copy of the paperwork needs to go to your landlord. If your landlord has an attorney,
  you need to bring it to their attorney. The address is written on your Summons and
  Complaint.
  
  % if format_date(case.answer_date) == format_date(today()):
  You must deliver the paperwork in person today. You cannot mail it.
  % endif

  Some landlords or landlord's attorneys will allow you to deliver the paperwork
  by fax or email. However, you must call and confirm with your landlord before
  faxing or emailing. The landlord has to agree to get the paperwork this way.

  When and how will you bring the paperwork to your landlord or their attorney?
fields: 
  - Delivery method: method_of_service
    choices:
      - Mail: mailed
      - Delivering by hand: delivered in-hand
